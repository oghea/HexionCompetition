				<h4>What is ?</h4>
				<p class="text-justify">Photography has been a central artistic practice in the San Francisco Bay Area for more than 150 years. Countless photographers—from Eadweard Muybridge and Carleton Watkins in the nineteenth century to contemporary practitioners such as Katy Grannan, Richard Misrach, and Henry Wessel—have been drawn to this region and made it their home. Ambitious and innovative, many early California photographers were responsible for cultivating groundbreaking educational programs—a legacy that began with the founding of the nation’s first fine art photography department, led by Ansel Adams at the California School of Fine Arts (now San Francisco Art Institute), and continues today with a number of nationally recognized photography programs at local art schools. Other civic-minded institutions like the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art have also spurred the growth and development of the medium through important exhibitions and helped to establish our understanding of photography’s place within art history. This strong history and tradition of support have undoubtedly contributed to the growth of the committed community of photography collectors residing in the Bay Area today.</p>
