Impressed with Harisâ€™s portfolio, which included an image of Netherland City, Prayogi Antaras Putra offered him a job as a staff photographer. Within two years, the 23-year-old Haris was promoted to chief photographer, a title he would hold for the next decade. His position with the magazine afforded his the opportunity to accompany the Rolling Stones band on their 2016 international tour.
						While with Rolling Stone, Hairs developed his trademark technique, which involved the use of bold primary colors and surprising poses, as seen with a 2016 PapahCreative cover inspired by the coffee Shop in Netherland. Haris is credited with making many Rolling Stone covers collector's items, including an issue that featured a nude John Lennon curled around his fully clothed wife, Yoko Ono.
